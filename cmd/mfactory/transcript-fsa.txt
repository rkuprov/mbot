Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:03:48 AM): Hi Roman. Thank you for contacting TriNet. My name is Saranya. How may I assist you today? 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:03:55 AM): Hi, Saranya! 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:04:29 AM): Hello. 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:04:35 AM): I'm wondering how I can reimburse my bank account for the eligible childcare expenses with my FSA account. 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:04:54 AM): I would be happy to assist you with that today. 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:05:13 AM): To submit a claim for reimbursement from your Flexible Spending Account, you can go to Benefits > Flexible Spending Accounts > Submit Claim. 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:05:15 AM): Our daycare charges way more per month than the contribution we make. So, I figured I could just withdraw the money i put in from time to time 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:05:49 AM): You would not be able to withdraw the money. 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:06:13 AM): The claims would be submitted manually and then reimbursement would be provided to you from your Dependent Care account. 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:06:59 AM): But where would that money be reimbursed to? Would they be added to my paycheck or directed to my bank account? 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:07:17 AM): It would be either Direct Deposit to the account associated with your payroll or via a paper check. If you allow me a moment I can confirm you preference. 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:07:27 AM): I was about to submit a claim, but it never asked me for my bank account 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:07:37 AM): Thank you 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:08:04 AM): You are set up for reimbursement via Direct Deposit. 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:08:13 AM): Awesome. Last question 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:08:59 AM): Can I do partial reimbursement or do they need to be exact? Like, my dependent care balance is $833 right now, but I already paid about $2500 in daycare costs to date 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:09:07 AM): (this year) 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:09:19 AM): Yes, you can do partial claims for what you have available. 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:09:51 AM): Is there anything else I can help you with? Additionally, for your convenience, you may access the chat transcript by clicking on Save Chat or Save Conversation prior to exiting the chat. 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:10:08 AM): Oh, great! So, I can just put in the bill that has a higher amount and withdraw what I have? 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:10:15 AM): That is correct. 
Saranya (3/18/2023, 8:10:32 AM): You would only be reimbursed what is available. 
Roman (3/18/2023, 8:10:46 AM): awesome! Thank you so much Saranya!
